## Details

- Approx. completion time: **2 hours**
- Deliverables: **1 HTML file, images**

Using the content and sketched wireframes provided, create a single HTML file that uses proper semantics to mark up the content.

*The look is **not** important. And no CSS is needed.*

Really consider the appropriate tags independent of how they look in the browser. Refer to the resources below to see if there are tags you have forgotten or didn’t realize exist to push the semantics further.
